## Project Description
This project is a responsive, multi-page web form built for BAIS:3300. It collects basic demographic and accessibility info and displays a confirmation page.

## Form Best Practices
I used required fields and autofocus to guide the user and reduce errors. The form is split into multiple short pages instead of one long page, which lowers drop-off and makes the content easier to process. I also used clear labels, simple language, and consistent Bootstrap layout so the form feels familiar.

The tooltip icons explain why weâ€™re asking about gender and age. That adds transparency, which builds trust and is considered a best practice in modern inclusive form design.

## Accessibility
The form uses proper `<label>` elements tied to form controls, logical tab order, large touch-friendly buttons, and responsive Bootstrap components. I also included high-contrast text, alt text on images, and avoided requiring any exact birthdate. This supports WCAG 2.1 AA expectations for clarity, focus order, and readability.
